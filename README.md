## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Overview
This document describes the **Entity-Relationship (ER) model** for a dental practice management system. It provides a structured approach to managing **patient care, staff scheduling, financial tracking, billing, insurance claims, and medical records**. 
---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Design Principles## 

The following bridge entities have been implemented to manage many-to-many  relationships effectively:**

### ‚úÖ Insurance & Billing
- **INSURANCE_COVERAGE**: Links patients to their respective insurance policies.  
- **INSURANCE_PAYMENT**: Tracks insurance contributions to patient billing records.  
- **BILLING_SERVICE_DETAILS**: Tracks which services are included in patient billing records.  

### ‚úÖ Scheduling & Operations
- **DAILY_STAFF_ASSIGNMENT**: Tracks staff assigned to daily schedules.  
- **ROOM_ASSIGNMENT**: Tracks staff-room assignments for procedures.  
- **APPOINTMENT_SERVICE**: Tracks services performed during appointments.  
- **TREATMENT_RECORD**: Links patients, staff, and treatments.  

### ‚úÖ Supplies & Equipment
- **SUPPLY_SERVICE_ROOM**: Tracks the assignment of supplies and equipment to services in specific rooms.  
- **EXPENSE_DETAILS**: Tracks supplies and equipment included in monthly expenses.  

### ‚úÖ Reports & Financial Tracking
- **DAILY_SERVICE_REPORT**: Associates services with end-of-day reports.  
- **MONTHLY_SERVICE_REPORT**: Associates services with monthly reports.  
- **MONTHLY_BILLING_RECORD**: Links billing records to salary generation.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Financial & Operational Assumptions

- **Monthly salaries** are funded by **patient billing records**, which are linked via the `MONTHLY_BILLING_RECORD` bridge entity.  
- Each **monthly report** aggregates multiple **end-of-day reports** to provide **financial summaries**.  
- **Each patient billing record** may be paid **partially or fully** by **multiple insurance policies** or **out-of-pocket**.  
- **Loan repayment** is included in financial tracking. The business has a **$300,000 loan** repaid over **10 years**, and each `MONTHLY_EXPENSES` report includes **loan installments and interest** as part of fixed costs.  
- The `SUPPLIES & EQUIPMENT` entity includes all **costs related to dental operations**, covering:
  - **Startup costs**: furniture, dental equipment, scheduling & billing software, supplies, and training.  
  - **Recurring monthly costs**: cleaning services, utilities, staff food, medical supplies (needles, drugs, paper towels, etc.).  
- The **monthly report** provides a **high-level financial and operational summary** of the dental practice, allowing business owners to assess **profitability and performance**.  
- **All expenses** are **aggregated in `MONTHLY_EXPENSES`**, which includes **staff salaries, lease payments, loan installments, supply purchases, and utility costs**. The `TOTAL_EXPENSES` field in the monthly report represents the **sum of all costs recorded in `MONTHLY_EXPENSES`** for that month.  
- **Revenue** is calculated from **patient billing records**, including both **insurance reimbursements** and **direct patient payments**.  
- **Profitability** is determined as:  
  `NET_PROFIT_LOSS = TOTAL_REVENUE - TOTAL_EXPENSES`  
- **Key operational insights** included in the monthly report:
  - **Total number of patients served**
  - **New patient acquisitions**
  - **Total insurance claims processed**  
- **Insurance payments** are explicitly tracked, distinguishing between **total insurance payments** and **out-of-pocket payments**, providing a **clear breakdown of revenue sources**.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Scheduling & Operations Assumptions

- Each **schedule of the day report** assigns **multiple staff members** and **lists assigned staff, patients, and rooms**.  
- Each **end-of-day report** contributes to **only one monthly report**, preventing duplicate reporting.  
- Each **room appears in multiple daily schedules**, ensuring accurate tracking of room usage.  
- **Patient scheduling states are explicitly tracked**:
  - **Contacted**: Patient has been reached but not yet scheduled.  
  - **Scheduled**: Appointment confirmed.  
  - **Recently Visited**: Patient completed an appointment recently.  
  - **Up for Next Visit**: Patient is due for a follow-up.  
  - **Dormant**: Patient has not scheduled a visit in a long time.
